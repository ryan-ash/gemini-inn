Oh, dear lord! This is gettin' outta hand. Them forest weirdos are throwin' a "bash," and they've invited all sorts of critters. We could've put up with them strange sounds while passin' through the woods or maybe even them luring our folks, but streakin' outta them woods and doin' that kind of business, well, that's just a bridge too far. Help us pack, 'cause we're hittin' the road for good. And don't you go callin' it a defeat!
