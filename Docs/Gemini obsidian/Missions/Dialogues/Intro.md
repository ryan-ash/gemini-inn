*Starting with a black screen. No music or sounds*

**Observer:**

	And who are you? Another one, huh? 
	...
	Wake up. Your working day is starting.

*Black screen disappears. The Player now sees the Inn. The music appears*

**Observer:**

	Hey.

*The camera suddenly moves to the side, the corner, where the Observer seats*

**Player:**
- Who are you?
- Where am I?
- Who am I?

No matter, what the Player choses

**Observer**:

	...
	You really don't remember..? (сделай текст полупрозрачным, как будто он тихо говорит~~)
	Let's leave those questions for later.
	I shall explain for you everything here. 
	Now look to the left corner. You will see 4 icons.
	They may seem for you boring.
	But each of them is really important as everything in _this_ world.

*Than the Travelers appear. Crowd noises appear*

**Observer**:

	Your customers.
	Those are not really interesting.
	But they have their own purpose and they are really important.

*First quest appears*

**Observer**:

	You first request appeared.
	You should be cautious. Some requests may disappear after some time.
	After all, patience is limited. Same is for their life.
	Now open the map. 

*The map opens. There is one quest (The frogs are now dancing the ballet)*

**Observer**:

	The quests usually requires special abilities.
	You could choose Travelers with such skills or don't, it's your choice.

*The Player chooses the team and sends it to the place*

**Observer**:

	This is it. This is your job.
	And at last
	Everything you're doing here is your choice.
	You can run from this fact, but in the end you face it everytime.
	I'll be here. We will talk again. 
	You can ask me anything.

**Player:**

	...

**Observer:**

	...

**Player:**

	..?

**Observer:**

	Any questions?

**Player:**

- Who are you? - Observer: Can't you read or something? I'm observer.
- Where am I? - The Inn.
- Who am I? - Tavernkeeper.

**Observer:**

	Why there are always the same questions? 
	Anything else?

**Tavernkeeper:**

	Am I really suposed to work in this godforsaken place?

**Observer:**

	I have to say yes. But to be honest it's up to you.
	Everything and everyone are important here.
	And your purpose is take care of it.
	Good luck.

*Observer is now quiet. The game starts.*
