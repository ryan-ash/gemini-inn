Dang it, Humans just plum worn us out! All they ever do is shame us. They done tricked us once more and led us straight into a trap. But them jungle druids done offered us a hand. They don't seem all that different from ours, at least not from what I can tell. If ya could spread the word 'bout yer plan to everyone else – them mermaids, them desert critters, them dwarfs – 'cept for them elves, we'll let them in on it later, our own selves.

When it's done
	From Magical Creatures: [[Attack Humans]]
	From Villagers: [[Promote the opening of a training camp for hunters]]
