*Short Version:* 
Gratitude for past aid flows unceasingly. Yet, destiny's path winds anew, prompting our plea once more. Our werewolves and druids, our steadfast guardians, now bear human-inflicted wounds. We implore your skilled healers, as ours are distant. Swift response is our ally.

Long Version:
 Greetings, esteemed tavernkeeper and intrepid travelers,

 We extend our heartfelt appreciation for thy past aid. Alas, destiny's tapestry continues to weave, and once more, we find ourselves in need of thy noble assistance. Our stalwart defenders, the valiant werewolves and wise druids, now bear wounds inflicted by the hands of human aggressors.

 With the weight of honor, we beseech thee to deploy thy skilled healers. Our own menders reside within the distant heart of our forest realm, rendering them unable to reach us in our hour of need. Time, a fleeting ally, urges swift action.

 In ardent anticipation, we stand united, By the grace of the Forest Nation.

If it's completed, then
