_Short Version:_
Greetings, esteemed innkeeper.

In our grand pursuit of absolute harmony, we must request the "werewolves" to cease their activities. Wolves, as noble guardians of their territory, are called upon to gracefully withdraw this time. A diplomatic visit, coupled with the bestowment of a few tokens of our goodwill, may suffice to achieve our shared objective without the need for explicit articulation.

When it's done
