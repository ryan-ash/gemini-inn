Hey there,

We're kinda low on berries, ya know? And yeah, we could pick 'em, but we're also keepin' an eye out for forest trouble. Having some help wouldn't hurt, in case things get wild.

Fingers crossed, Villagers wantin' some backup.

*Long version:*
Help us!
	Hello, dear travelers,

  We find ourselves in a bit of a quandary – we're short on berries. You might be pondering, why can't we do the gatherin' ourselves? Here's the rub: we've got our eyes peeled for any ruckus stirred up by those forest-dwellers. Having some extra hands around would go a long way in keepin' our worries at bay, just in case things take a sour turn.

  With hope in our hearts, Villagers in need of a friendly hand.

If it's completed, then
