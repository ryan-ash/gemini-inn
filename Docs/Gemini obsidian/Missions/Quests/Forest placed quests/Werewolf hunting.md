*Short Version:* 
Need help with werewolf huntin'. We're used to handlin' things solo, but these critters are tougher than we reckoned. They're strong, and, well, a bit on the eerie side. Could use some muscle and skilled hunters. Could ya send someone?
P.S. Be careful with those Forest perverts. I'm tellin' ya this "love" and "harmony" as they call it are no good for normal people like us.

*Long version:*
Help Us!
	Hi travelers. We need peeple to help us with werewolfs huntin. You might think wy cant we kill the beasts by ourselvs? Well... I mean, sure, we usually handle stuff like this on our own, but these beasts are a tad nastier than expected. They're like... really strong and, uh, kinda spooky. We need some muscle and good hunters. Could ya send someone over? 
	Hoping you can help, Just us regular folks dealin' with a hairy mess.
	P.S. Be careful with those Forest perverts. I'm tellin' ya this "love" and "harmony" as they call it are no good for normal people like us.
