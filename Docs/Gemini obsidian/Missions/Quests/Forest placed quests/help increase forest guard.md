*Short Version:* 
Honored tavernkeeper and fellow adventurers,

The humans persist in encroaching upon the woodland kingdom. We've tried conversing, but alas, our words fall on deaf ears. They wreak havoc, slaying creatures and even those they dub "werewolves," sparing none, including us. Humans might label us as "spoiled" or "perverts," but they can't grasp the true essence of harmony, the union with nature. A declaration of war is not our aim. Your alliance is sought â€“ stand with us.

With steadfast resolve, The Forest Nation.

When it's done

	From Werewolves: [[Fight Humans!]]
