Honored tavernkeeper and fellow adventurers,

The humans persist in encroaching upon the woodland kingdom. We've tried conversing, but alas, our words fall on deaf ears. They wreak havoc, slaying creatures and even those they dub "werewolves," sparing none, including us. A declaration of war is not our aim; we seek defense while devising a more formidable strategy. Your alliance is sought â€“ stand with us.

With steadfast resolve, The Forest Nation.

When it's done
	From Elves: [[Diplomacy with werewolves]]
	From Werewolves: [[Fight Humans!]]
