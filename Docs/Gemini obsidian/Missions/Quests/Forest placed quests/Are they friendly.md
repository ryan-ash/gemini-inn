What the Hell?! Them forest folks done brought us a *"gift."* What in the blazes are we s'posed to do with this contraption? Use a *long log* to till the fields or give the dog a new chew toy? Them pointy-eared critters sure as heck don't know nothin' 'bout our way of life!
...But, well, it appears our womenfolk have figured out what this contraption is for. So, in return for this, uh, "lovely" gift, we'll send 'em some poppies. Just make sure there ain't no attacks this time!
When it's done
