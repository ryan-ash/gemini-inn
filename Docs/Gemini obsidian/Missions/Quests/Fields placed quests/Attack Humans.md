These druids, they're actin' kinda strange. Always blabberin' 'bout takin' over the world, but none of us rightly grasp what they mean. Plus, they got this habit of losin' their limbs every now and then. And lemme tell ya, they don't smell too good neither. But, anyhow, the key thing now is to deal with these parasites. People are worse than ticks, I tell ya. One mermaid even claimed that mosquitoes are more appealin' and capable? than 'em. Can ya lend a hand? We're right sure nothin' bad's gonna happen.
