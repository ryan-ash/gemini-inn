_Short Version:_
Howdy again,

Them forest weirdos ain't lettin' up, keep sendin' their creepy dogs our way. Can't stand us enjoyin' the woods, wanna keep those critters all to themselves? We gotta band together against these "amateur" tree-huggers and set up more hunter camps, teach some more hunters how to throw a stick to a dog. You reckon you wanna join in our quest for glory?

When it's done
