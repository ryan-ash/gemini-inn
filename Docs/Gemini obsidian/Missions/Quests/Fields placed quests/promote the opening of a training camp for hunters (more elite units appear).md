Hey there,

Remember us? You've bailed us out before, so we're betting you're up for another round. Those pesky werewolves? Yeah, they're still causing chaos, and there's a shortage of folks who can deal with 'em. We wrote a fancy letter to the "glorious" king, and guess what? He said he'd set up a training thingamajig right here!

So, we're sendin' you this message. We're all in the same boat, bein' human 'n all. So, can you see why we're askin' for your help? We ain't too keen on lettin' them beasties make a meal outta us, y'know?

Hope you're with us, Just a bunch of regular folks tryin' to stay alive.

When it's done
	[[Prepare for Jungle's exploration]]
