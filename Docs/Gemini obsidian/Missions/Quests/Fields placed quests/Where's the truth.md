Alright, so on our last trek, we didn't stumble upon as many of them walking potatoes as we thought we would. But, here's the twist, we stumbled upon some abandoned camps, and there was some scribbled paperwork lyin' 'round. It says "diery" or somethin'. My boys can't make heads or tails of it, so you can take this gibberish if you fancy it. I got a hunch it might be important.

When it's done:
The truth about ***Crazy Druids*** comes out - [[Crazy druids might cause the real danger]]
