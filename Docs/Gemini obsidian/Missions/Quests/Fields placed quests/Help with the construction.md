*Short Version:* 
We're eager to expand our village. We're confident it'll be as grand as a king's realm one day. No more fretting about winter needs. The tavern might become a merry spot for relaxation and drinks, not just for hired hands. We're gonna be the biggest and strongest. Join us?

Long:
Hello,

We've got a hankering to stretch our legs a bit and do some expandin'. Could you pitch in with the buildin'? Here's no doubt one day our little village will grow up to be as grand as a king's realm. Then we wouldn't have to fret 'bout food and supplies come winter. The tavern might even turn into a merry spot for relaxin' and tipplin', instead of just a place for hired hands to gather. We will be the biggest and the strongest! Wanna join us?

Anticipatin' your arrival, Folks with aspirations.
