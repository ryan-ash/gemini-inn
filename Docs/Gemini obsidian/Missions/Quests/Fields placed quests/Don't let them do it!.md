YOU BETTER LISTEN UP! THIS IS AS SERIOUS AS A BOTTLE OF MOONSHINE ON SUNDAY! HUMANS, YOU CAN'T LET 'EM ANYWHERE NEAR THAT DANG JUNGLE! IT'LL BE A CATASTROPHE, I TELL YA! THE THINGS LURKIN' IN THERE, THEY DON'T DESERVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY! THEY GOTTA BE BLUE, AND I MEAN YESTERDAY! THEY'RE LIKE A BUNCH OF SNAKES IN A PIGSTY! DON'T LET 'EM FOOL YA. STOP THEM RIGHT NOW!

When it's done
