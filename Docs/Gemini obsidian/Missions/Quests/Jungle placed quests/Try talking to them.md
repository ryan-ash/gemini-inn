We don't usually talk much, but we reckon it's worth mentionin'. Now that we know what's goin' on with them Druids, should we still help 'em out? The Elves, they've been sayin' not to, but considerin' their peculiar fascination with the word "harmony" and all, should we trust their judgment? We ain't lookin' to harm innocents here. What d'you think 'bout checkin' on them Druids first?
When it's done
