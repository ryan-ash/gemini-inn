*Short Version:* 
We need a favor. These humans keep messin' with our vibe. They're like fish thieves and poppy-heads, and they can't even keep their clothes on. Their own stupidity dunks them underwater, not our prob. Can you talk to 'em for us? They won't listen to us. Have fun with the brainless bunch.

*Long version*:
Ugh, seriously? Humans... Salutations, innkeeper and minions,

We're in this totally annoying situation and, like, we're sorta turning to you for help. It's seriously pathetic how these mortals can't resist sticking their noses in our business. First, they barge into our waters, snatching up fish like it's a buffet, and we're, like, starving. Then they show up all zonked on those coastal poppies, toting buckets like they're geniuses. And, like, the grand finale â€“ they strip down and waltz into our territory, all disgusting and stuff.

Like, whatever, their own stupidity dunked them underwater. Just wanna make it clear, it's not our fault.

So, like, here's the thing, we're asking you to talk to these numbskulls for us. 'Cause they won't listen to us. Have fun dealing with the brainless bunch.

With, like, some eye rolls, The Sirens of, like, Superiority or whatever

If it's done, then
