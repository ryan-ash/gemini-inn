*Short Version:* 
Stuck with fishin' trouble in siren waters. These slippery critters keep nabbin' our folks, and the missin' person reports are piling up – all 'cause they're up for some mischief, can you imagine? Winter's comin', and we're starvin' as it is. If you could spare someone to help us out, we'd be mighty thankful.

*Long version*:
Hey there, travelers,

We're kinda stuck and could use a hand catchin' fish in the siren-filled waters. These sneaky water critters keep snatchin' our folks away, and we're gettin' tired of puttin' out missin' person notices – all 'cause they're lookin' for some fun, can you believe it? We're hungry as a bear come winter, so if you could send someone to lend a hand, we'd be much obliged.

Hoping for a full belly, Just a bunch of regular village folk.
