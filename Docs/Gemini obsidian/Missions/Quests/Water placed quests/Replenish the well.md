*Short Version:*  
Got a favor to ask this time – our well needs fillin'. You might be thinkin', why ain't we doin' it? Well, here's the scoop: we sent our lads down, but they vanished. Them mermaids, up to their tricks. We're thirsty as a desert, so a hand'd be grand. Much obliged if you could pitch in.

*Long version*:
Greetings, fellow wanderers,

We've got a favor to ask this time 'round – we need a hand fillin' up our well. You might be wonderin', why don't we do it ourselves? Well, here's the rub: we sent a couple of our lads down there, but they never made their way back up. Seems those mermaids are at it again, causin' trouble. Anyhow, we're mighty parched and could use a sip, so if you could lend a hand, we'd be mighty grateful.

Wishing you well, Folks in need of a sip.
