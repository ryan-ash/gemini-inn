*Short Version:* 
We've hit a snag, and it's a bit of a buzzkill – we're running low on the good stuff. Heard you're the tavern guru, and we're in need of some liquid courage. Not just wine, mind you – ale, honey, whatever floats your boat. Trouble is, we're not in the best state to go fetch it ourselves, if you catch my drift. Trying to morph into bats while buzzed is like juggling fire hoops.
So, we're counting on you.

Long:
Yo, yo, what's crackin', my friend?

How you doin', man? We got ourselves a bit of a situation here, gotta admit. It's a small hiccup, but it's buzz-kill central – we're runnin' dry on the good stuff. Now, I heard you're like the tavern wizard, and we're in dire need of some liquid courage, you feel me? We ain't just talkin' wine; we're talkin' ale, honey – heck, toss in whatever tickles your fancy, just give us a taste. Thing is, we're a bit incapacitated, if you catch my drift. Tryin' to morph into bats while you're on drugs, well, it's a bit like tryin' to juggle flaming hoops, man.

So, here's the deal – we're countin' on you. Whether you're packin' minions, travelers, or whoever's willin' to venture into our vibe, they're welcome to chill for a bit, too. We'll make it worth their while, you know what I'm sayin'?

Stay groovy, 
Your friendly neighborhood nightwalkers.

When it's done
