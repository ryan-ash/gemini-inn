  Hey,
So, you've chatted with my dad, huh? He's a buzzkill, but cool you're on board. Dad's all about our rep. Whatever. Being stuck with etiquette and status? Not my jam. But he's got a point. If we mess up, humans'll be in our faces.
Being a vamp? No choice. Born this way, like Lady Blahblah says. But humans? They think we're freak accidents. Anyways, we need help to clean up our mess. Can you help us out?
Thanks, Vamp Vlad

Hey there,

So, I'm guessin' you've had a little chat with my dad, huh? Yeah, he's a bit of a buzzkill, but props to you for rollin' with it. Ol' pops is all hot 'n bothered 'bout this whole reputation thing. Whatever, right? I ain't too keen on bein' boxed in by all that fancy schmancy etiquette and high-and-mighty status stuff. But, I mean, he's got a point, I guess. If we don't play our cards right, humans folks are gonna be all up in our business.

Look, bein' a vampire ain't exactly a choice, man. We're born this way, like Lady Blahblah said. But humans, they still see us as these freak accidents of nature or whatever. Anyways, onto the real deal â€“ we kinda need a hand cleanin' up the mess from that little escapade. You know, just sweepin' things under the rug, so to speak. Can you hook us up with some help?

Appreciate it, dude, 
Vamp Vlad.
