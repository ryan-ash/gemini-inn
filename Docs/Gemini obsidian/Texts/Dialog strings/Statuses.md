- The travelers are on the way.
- The rats are going, hope they won't kill each other on the way.
- The group is giving the hope, what a miracle !

- The travelers are almost done
- Look like they’re trying their best
- They are closer to the victory than to a chance of finding someone for night

- The travelers complete the quest
- Well, they did it.
- Nothing special, I chose ‘em.

- The travelers didn’t make it.
- Shoot.. Another corpses 
- It was stupid. Sorry.

- The rats ran away.
- The monsters were scarier than you - minions ran away.
- Cowards!

- some minions are dead, some not - I guess the stupidest are, so it’s not such a big deal.
- maybe I do have to raise the price 

- some travelers died because of poisoned mushrooms - a lack of a healer or good tactic
- some travelers died because of crazy cows - a lack of good fighter
- they lost on the way, some of them died - a lack of cartographer 
- some of them just died for no reason. Maybe it’s the plague again - a lack of a healer
