**From [[Villagers]]**:
Hello,

We've got a hankering to stretch our legs a bit and do some expandin'. Could you pitch in with the buildin'? Who knows, maybe one day our little village could grow up to be as grand as a king's realm. Then we wouldn't have to fret 'bout food and supplies come winter. The tavern might even turn into a merry spot for relaxin' and tipplin', instead of just a place for hired hands to gather. But best not to dwell on dreams â€“ they won't fill our bellies. We're lookin' forward to your help.

Anticipatin' your arrival, Folks with aspirations.
