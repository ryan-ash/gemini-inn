And thus, we reach the culmination of our grand odyssey. This remarkable adventure, etched in time, shall forever remain indelible, all thanks to your valiant spirits. The map unfurls, each line a testament to the journey shared, each relic an embodiment of the wondrous mysteries unravelled. Oh, who's to say if these treasures shall grace you as tangible rewards or adorn the shelf as cherished mementos, each whispering tales of our escapades.

Rest assured, the prospect of our paths diverging tugs at the heartstrings, for farewells, even temporary, bear a tinge of melancholy. Yet, fear not, for our tapestry of tales remains incomplete, and I eagerly anticipate the day our narratives intertwine once more.

Adieu for now, dear comrades, 'til our destinies intertwine anew.
