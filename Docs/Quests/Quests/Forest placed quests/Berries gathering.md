**From [[Villagers]]**:

Help us!
	Hello, dear travelers,

  We find ourselves in a bit of a quandary – we're short on berries. You might be pondering, why can't we do the gatherin' ourselves? Here's the rub: we've got our eyes peeled for any ruckus stirred up by those forest-dwellers. Having some extra hands around would go a long way in keepin' our worries at bay, just in case things take a sour turn.

  With hope in our hearts, Villagers in need of a friendly hand.

If it's completed, then
