Greetings, honored innkeeper,

I trust you are well. I was recently apprised, through means of a trusty winged messenger, that a group of humans, patrons of your establishment, journeyed to one of our abodes at the behest of my rather...intemperate son. Regrettably, inebriation played its part, resulting in the absence of certain members of your staff.

I kindly beseech you to dispatch emissaries to ensure the safe return of my son's associates. While I value your patronage, I implore your discretion concerning this incident. Our vampire reputation is already fraught, and I urge your assistance in preserving our delicate status.

With heartfelt gratitude for your understanding, 
A Concerned Vampire
