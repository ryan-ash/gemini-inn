  
Greetings once more,

Allow us to extend our weary voices to your ears once again, for it seems our prior entreaties did not fall on deaf ears. It appears that not all humans are as insufferably sluggish as we initially presumed. Alas, a storm darkens our horizon. 

News of the impending industrial fishing threat has surely reached you by now. Our hearts weigh heavy with the knowledge that our young ones may face a perilous fate. We, in our vulnerability, implore you to undertake an unthinkable act â€“ to defy your own kind. 

Our desire is not for annihilation, but for the chance to survive in our only sanctuary, a realm where escape is nigh impossible. We clasp our voices together in this solemn plea: Please, we beg of you, extend your hand to our beleaguered kind.

With bated breath and heavy hearts, 
The Sirens, beseeching mercy.
