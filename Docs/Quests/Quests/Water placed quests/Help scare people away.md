Ugh. Humans...
Greetings, innkeeper and underlings,

We find ourselves in an unforeseen quandary and are reluctantly turning to you for assistance. It appears that these wretched mortals cannot resist meddling in our affairs. First, they invade our waters for their meager catches, depleting our sustenance. Then, they arrive stoned on coastal poppies, wielding buckets and displaying idiocy. Most vexingly, they dare to intrude upon us, naked and repulsive.

Their fate was sealed by their own folly, as our swift reflexes left them submerged. This, we emphasize, is not our concern.

Reluctantly, we implore you to communicate with these imbeciles on our behalf. They will not listen to us. It falls upon your shoulders to rectify this nuisance. Good luck reaching the brainless.

With a mixture of disdain and amusement, The Sirens of Superiority

If it's done, then
