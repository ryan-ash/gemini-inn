**From [[Villagers]]**
Hey there, travelers,

We're kinda stuck and could use a hand catchin' fish in the siren-filled waters. These sneaky water critters keep snatchin' our folks away, and we're gettin' tired of puttin' out missin' person notices – all 'cause they're lookin' for some fun, can you believe it? We're hungry as a bear come winter, so if you could send someone to lend a hand, we'd be much obliged.

Hoping for a full belly, Just a bunch of regular village folk.
