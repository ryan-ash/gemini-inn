Hey there, travelers,

We wanted to give you a shoutout for lendin' a hand with the fishin' last time. Thanks to you, we filled our bellies and even got some extra gold when the king bought our catch. It all worked out real fine. Now, we're lookin' for a couple of willing souls to help us set up a proper fishin' operation with nets. We reckon you're up for the task. Ha, progress is knockin' at our door! Before you know it, we'll be sayin' goodbye to hunger and hard times. Let's get to it!

With high hopes, Villagers ready for a change.
