The [[Druids]] and [[Elves]] of the Forest are aware of the affairs of the [[Crazy Druids]]. Their behavior can destroy all life around them. The forest is troubled. [[Crazy Druids]] are former [[Druids]] from the forest who did not die after the invasion. Everyone thinks they’re angry when they’re actually losing their minds more and more because of the virus that they want to fight, but they’ve become its victims. It is not advantageous for the [[Elves]] to reveal these details: they know that the madmen cannot be helped, and they do not want to be considered heroes and tried to save them.
