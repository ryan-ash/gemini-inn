Forbidden place. Everyone who enters there, waiting for death. Depending on luck, death will be quick or painful. There are Crazy Druids ([[Crazy jungle folks]]) who have troubles with the head and Living mushrooms. The jungle is a breeding ground for disease and mutation. The more travelers go in there, the faster the filth spreads.
