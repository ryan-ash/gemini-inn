The forest is a popular place, many [[Humans]] go there for recreation, gathering berries and mushrooms, hunting. In the dark [[Werewolves]] appear in the forest and sometimes run to the villages. There are [[Hunters]] for them. The forest is also home to [[Elves]] and [[Druids]] who keep order and harmony. Besides the forest animals, there are also various [[Magical creatures]], but all that is known about them are legends.
