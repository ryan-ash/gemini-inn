* "The Bane of the Afflicted: A Hero's Descent" - Please, traveler. I need you to intervene.

	A recent outbreak of some weird disease has caused the townsfolk to go insane. Unfortunately we have no cure and their disease will lead to 	a painful death. Hero, I know this is a terrible task to ask of you, but we need you to end their suffering. Know that we found who's 			responsible, we'll get those miserable undead. My duties prevent me from going with you, but I doubt I'd be needed anyway.
	Tread carefully hero, only a fool would underestimate the undead. Kill as many of them as you'd like, just make sure you don't forget your 		main goal.

	I hope you're not looking for a big reward, but we'll still be able to reward you with something decent. Please succeed hero, we believe in you.

4. rocks
5. grass
* Traveler's Request: "The Silly Seeker's Sought-After Squirrel" - another weird request from this village, be careful with those crazy men.
Dear traveler, I have an utterly preposterous and amusing request to make of you. Our whimsical town's most eccentric resident, known as the Silly Seeker, has set their heart on capturing a truly peculiar creature—the elusive, mischievous, and outrageously comedic tap-dancing squirrel!

* “plants or undeads?” - it seems some of undeads are navigating to grass fields, help citizens to defend themselves.
Forgive me, hero. I need a favor of you.

There is so much left to do, but so little time to do it in. I need to clean the stables, I need to sow the fields, feed my livestock, hunt for food and so much more. Please, could you help me with some of my tasks? I'm afraid my farm would collapse without your help.

I'm happy to say I'll be able to reward you handsomely for your troubles.

6. desert
* “sand is not sweet” -in the heart of the scorching desert, rumors whisper of a hidden oasis that holds ancient wisdom and untold treasures. Your mission is to navigate the blistering dunes, decode enigmatic clues, and unlock the secrets of this concealed sanctuary. Find the gold lizard.

* “Or they’ll drown in their own tears”
Please, adventurer. Please, help me out.

We've been struck by a dry spell, no rain has touched our lands for months and we're starting to feel its toll. Many of us are already too weak to do any real work and I'm afraid our first death will occur in a matter of days. Hero, please join me to the water pools, they're our last hope. If we bring 4 donkeys who should be able to carry plenty of water to at least save us for a while.

It pains me to say I won't be able to reward you with a lot, but I'll do my best to make it worth your while.

7. anywhere:
* “it is not easy to bury the body”
Please, adventurer. You've got to help me.

My husband has fallen ill, he won't wake up no matter what I do. I believe we need to make him drink tea brewed from silverleaf, but they only grow higher up the mountain and I cannot leave my husband's side. Please, hero, gather a handful of silverleaf as quick as you can.

I don't have have a lot of possessions, but I'll reward you with what I can.

* “it is not about the size”
'Scuse me, adventurer. You're a sight for sore eyes.

We've been under constant harassment, our food has been stolen along with our gold and we're powerless to do anything to stop them. Hero, we need you to get rid of those cruel gnomes. I offer you my assistance, but it's up to you if you want me to join you or not.
We're counting on you to deal with those gnomes. Kill as many of them as you'd like, just make sure you don't forget your main goal.

I had hoped I'd be able to reward you handsomely, but unfortunately I don't have a lot left. Be swift and strike true hero, we're counting on you.

* “don’t repeat the mistakes of the past generations”
kill all the rats in “The safest village”

* “crazy? I was crazy once…” - if the “don’t repeat mistakes of the past generations” failed 
Forgive me, hero. I need your help.

A recent outbreak of some weird disease has caused the townsfolk to go insane. Unfortunately we have no cure and their disease will lead to a painful death. Hero, I know this is a terrible task to ask of you, but we need you to end their suffering. Know that we found who's responsible, we'll get those filthy monsters. It'll be dangerous, but I'm willing to come along if you need me to.
Be strong and swift when fighting the monsters. Make sure they regret the day they ever set foot in our lives.

Unfortunately there's not much I have to reward you with, but I think there's a few bits and pieces left. Justice will prevail hero and today you are our justice.
